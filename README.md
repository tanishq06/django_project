# snippet_viewer
This project is for users of the Django web framework to come together and share useful "snippets" of reusable code.

If you're just here to browse, you can look through snippets organized by author, by language or by tag. You can also have a look at the top-rated snippets and the most-bookmarked snippets.

If you'd like to contribute, sign up for a free account and you'll be able to post snippets of your own, rate and bookmark snippets, and post comments. If you've got any questions, have a look at our FAQ.
